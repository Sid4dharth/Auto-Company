# Experimental Design Checklist

## Research Question Formulation

### Is the Question Well-Formed?
- [ ] **Specific:** Clearly defined variables and relationships
- [ ] **Answerable:** Can be addressed with available methods
- [ ] **Relevant:** Addresses a gap in knowledge or practical need
- [ ] **Feasible:** Resources, time, and ethical considerations allow it
- [ ] **Falsifiable:** Can be proven wrong if incorrect

### Have You Reviewed the Literature?
- [ ] Identified what's already known
- [ ] Found gaps or contradictions to address
- [ ] Learned from methodological successes and failures
- [ ] Identified appropriate outcome measures
- [ ] Determined typical effect sizes in the field

## Hypothesis Development

### Is Your Hypothesis Testable?
- [ ] Makes specific, quantifiable predictions
- [ ] Variables are operationally defined
- [ ] Specifies direction/nature of expected relationships
- [ ] Can be falsified by potential observations

### Types of Hypotheses
- [ ] **Null hypothesis (H₀):** No effect/relationship exists
- [ ] **Alternative hypothesis (H₁):** Effect/relationship exists
- [ ] **Directional vs. non-directional:** One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests

## Study Design Selection

### What Type of Study is Appropriate?

**Experimental (Intervention) Studies:**
- [ ] **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):** Gold standard for causation
- [ ] **Quasi-experimental:** Non-random assignment but manipulation
- [ ] **Within-subjects:** Same participants in all conditions
- [ ] **Between-subjects:** Different participants per condition
- [ ] **Factorial:** Multiple independent variables
- [ ] **Crossover:** Participants receive multiple interventions sequentially

**Observational Studies:**
- [ ] **Cohort:** Follow groups over time
- [ ] **Case-control:** Compare those with/without outcome
- [ ] **Cross-sectional:** Snapshot at one time point
- [ ] **Ecological:** Population-level data

**Consider:**
- [ ] Can you randomly assign participants?
- [ ] Can you manipulate the independent variable?
- [ ] Is the outcome rare (favor case-control) or common?
- [ ] Do you need to establish temporal sequence?
- [ ] What's feasible given ethical, practical constraints?

## Variables

### Independent Variables (Manipulated/Predictor)
- [ ] Clearly defined and operationalized
- [ ] Appropriate levels/categories chosen
- [ ] Manipulation is sufficient to test hypothesis
- [ ] Manipulation check planned (if applicable)

### Dependent Variables (Outcome/Response)
- [ ] Directly measures the construct of interest
- [ ] Validated and reliable measurement
- [ ] Sensitive enough to detect expected effects
- [ ] Appropriate for statistical analysis planned
- [ ] Primary outcome clearly designated

### Control Variables
- [ ] **Confounding variables identified:**
  - Variables that affect both IV and DV
  - Alternative explanations for findings
- [ ] **Strategy for control:**
  - Randomization
  - Matching
  - Stratification
  - Statistical adjustment
  - Restriction (inclusion/exclusion criteria)
  - Blinding

### Extraneous Variables
- [ ] Potential sources of noise identified
- [ ] Standardized procedures to minimize
- [ ] Environmental factors controlled
- [ ] Time of day, setting, equipment standardized

## Sampling

### Population Definition
- [ ] **Target population:** Who you want to generalize to
- [ ] **Accessible population:** Who you can actually sample from
- [ ] **Sample:** Who actually participates
- [ ] Difference between these documented

### Sampling Method
- [ ] **Probability sampling (preferred for generalizability):**
  - Simple random sampling
  - Stratified sampling
  - Cluster sampling
  - Systematic sampling
- [ ] **Non-probability sampling (common but limits generalizability):**
  - Convenience sampling
  - Purposive sampling
  - Snowball sampling
  - Quota sampling

### Sample Size
- [ ] **A priori power analysis conducted**
  - Expected effect size (from literature or pilot)
  - Desired power (typically .80 or .90)
  - Significance level (typically .05)
  - Statistical test to be used
- [ ] Accounts for expected attrition/dropout
- [ ] Sufficient for planned subgroup analyses
- [ ] Practical constraints acknowledged

### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
- [ ] Clearly defined and justified
- [ ] Not overly restrictive (limits generalizability)
- [ ] Based on theoretical or practical considerations
- [ ] Ethical considerations addressed
